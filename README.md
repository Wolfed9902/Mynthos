# Mynthos

## About

Mynthos is a simple, dynamic world generator programmed primarily in Python.

Mynthos uses concepts such as perlin noise and procedural generation to create tile-based 2D maps with user defined size.
These tiles are independent entities that contain their own data, including but not limited to: terrain type (biome), temperature, and traversability.
